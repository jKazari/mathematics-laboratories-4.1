# Algorithms and Data Structures class laboratories
Repository of solutions to my **Algorithms and Data Structures** (`C++`) laboratories on the **4th semester** of studying Mathematics at Gda≈Ñsk University of Technology

## The laboratory outline
1. Warm-up (syntax, datatypes, I/O, file handling, strings, arrays, vectors, chrono)
2. C-style arrays, std::array, std::vector
3. Linked lists

## Projects outline
0. Measuring the time complexity of given algorithms
1. Implementing a dynamic array
2. Implementing a doubly linked list
